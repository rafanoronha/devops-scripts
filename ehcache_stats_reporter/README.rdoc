== Ehcache Stats Reporter

This is a PowerShell script I wrote in order to check the behavior of multiple standalone application nodes of Ehcache.

Ehcache stats are gathered via jmx and reported to a csv file.

This script depends on a java tool called Jmxterm. Check it out at http://wiki.cyclopsgroup.org/jmxterm.
